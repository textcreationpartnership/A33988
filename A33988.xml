         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HIS mo≈øt Excellent Maje≈øty King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, who was a great Lover of the Noble Art of NAVIGATION, finding that there were no Sea-Charts or Maps of the≈øe Kingdoms but what were <hi>Dutch,</hi> and Copies from them, and tho≈øe very erroneous, his Maje≈øty out of his great Zeal for the better Improvement of Navigation, was pleas'd in the Year 1681. to give me the Command of a Yatch for the making this Survey; in which Service I ≈øpent Seven years time.</p>
                  <p>The Intent of this Survey is only to give Directions to Mariners to Sail along≈øt the Coa≈øt of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and how to carry a Ship into any Harbour, River, Port, Road, Bay, or Creek with ≈øafety, and how to avoid all Dangers known.</p>
                  <p>It ≈øometimes happens, and that too frequently, that when Ships which have made long and dangerous Voyages, and are come home richly Laden, have been ≈øhipwrack't on their Native Coa≈øt, whereby both Merchants, Owners and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners have been impoveri≈øh't. All our Neighbours will acknowledge that no Nation abounds more with skilful and experienced Seamen than our own, none meeting a Danger with more Courage or Bravery; none taking more Care, or u≈øe more Circum≈øpection to prevent it, or are more laborious to overcome it: But we cannot expect that the Ma≈øter and Mates of every Ship ≈øhould be acquainted with all the Coa≈øts and Harbours of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> into which they may be accidentally obliged to Enter. Sometimes it happens, that in long Voyages the Ma≈øter and the mo≈øt knowing Men die, and the Ship is brought into ≈øight of Land by tho≈øe who have skill enough to conduct the Ship at Sea, but are wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
<pb facs="tcp:45469:8"/> with the Coa≈øts and Harbours, or having but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Knowledge, dare not tru≈øt to it; in ≈øuch Ca≈øes, and to ≈øuch Per≈øons, this Survey will ≈øerve in the room of a Pilot.</p>
                  <p>As many Ships are lo≈øt by Ignorance and Negligence, as by ≈øtre≈øs of Weather, ≈øo a Ma≈øter of a Ship hath a very great Charge, and ought to be a ≈øober Man, as well as a skilful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner: All helps of Art, Care, and Circum≈øpection are to be u≈øed by him, that the Lives of Mariners (the mo≈øt u≈øeful of their Maje≈øties Subjects at this Juncture) and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of hone≈øt Merchants under his Care, may be pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. To ≈øupply the Defects of which, I have been Employed by their Maje≈øties Predece≈ø≈øors, and Encouraged by Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and Noble Benefactors; and as I have hitherto made it my Bu≈øine≈øs to make tho≈øe true Figures of our Coa≈øts and Harbours ≈øo to ≈øerve my Country, I ≈øhall not be wanting to give them ≈øuch Additions and Amendments as I ≈øhall find hereafter needful: Wi≈øhing you always happy and ≈øucce≈øsful Voyages, and ≈øafe Returns, with Pro≈øperity to the Nation and its Forces by Sea and Land, that as we have been hitherto, ≈øo we may even be at home Soveraigns of the Seas, and Umpiers of the Differences betwixt our Neighbours abroad, which as it is every good man's Wi≈øh, ≈øo is it the con≈øtant hearty Prayer of</p>
